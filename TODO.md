# TODO

- gati
- tala
- playback could adjust rate to match note length (if shorter than sample)
- highlight syllable where pulse falls?
- silences could have samples attached...
    + to help understand where beats lie
    + like intake of breath

- stresses are currently capital letters, could be indicated by spaces e.g.

TakaTakita vs taka takita

Maybe both? this allows groupings and accenting, e.g. on the pulse

takataKita

They can be different things, e.g. stress vs pulse
