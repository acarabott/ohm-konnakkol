# TODO

- extensions/rests
  - get input from nagaraj
  - starting phrase with a rest
- gati
- lower speed _ / higher speed ^ * ' `
- tala
- highlight syllable where pulse falls?

- stresses are currently capital letters, could be indicated by spaces e.g.

TakaTakita vs taka takita

Maybe both? this allows groupings and accenting, e.g. on the pulse

takataKita

They can be different things, e.g. stress vs pulse
